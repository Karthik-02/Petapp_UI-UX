# Problem Statement: 
Design a comprehensive pet care management app.

#Description:
In today's world, pet ownership is on the rise, and pet owners are looking for innovative ways to
keep their pets healthy, happy, and safe. The challenge is to design a comprehensive pet care
management app that helps pet owners keep track of their pets' health, well-being, and daily
activities. The app should be user-friendly, accessible, and customizable to meet the unique
needs of different pet owners and their pets.
The pet care management app should provide features such as:
● Health Management: The app should allow pet owners to keep track of their pet's health
records, including vaccinations, check-ups, and medications. The app should also
provide reminders for upcoming appointments and medication doses.
● Activity Tracking: The app should allow pet owners to track their pet's daily activities,
including exercise, playtime, and rest. The app should provide insights into the pet's
activity levels and suggest ways to improve their well-being.
● Nutrition Management: The app should provide recommendations for healthy diets
based on the pet's age, breed, and health conditions. The app should also allow pet
owners to track their pet's food intake and provide reminders for meal times.
● Safety Features: The app should have safety features in place to ensure the safety of
the pet. This could include location tracking, alerts for unexpected departures, and
emergency contact information.
● Customizability: The app should allow pet owners to customize the app according to
their specific needs and preferences. This could include the option to upload pet photos,
set reminders, and choose the type of alerts they receive.
The final submission should include a detailed wireframe, high-fidelity prototype of the app's key
features and functionalities. The prototype should be user-friendly, accessible, and
customizable, and demonstrate a deep understanding of the unique needs of pet owners and
their pets.
